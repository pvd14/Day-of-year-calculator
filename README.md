# Day-of-year-calculator
Challenge is to develop a  calendar calculator without using any libraries.
The program will take input year and day number, for example: 2021111 or 200046 and will return the current date in format yearmonthday. For example, entering 2021111 where 2021 is the year and 111 is the 111th day of the year will result in 20210421 which is the 21st of April 2021. 200046 will give 20000215 which is the 15th of February 2000. The program also will  work for leap years.
